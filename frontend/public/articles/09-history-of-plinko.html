        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Plinko has an unusual origin story for a casino game. Unlike slots, poker, or roulette, which were born in gambling halls, Plinko started as a scientific instrument before becoming one of the most beloved television game show segments in history. Its journey from Victorian-era statistics demonstration to modern online casino phenomenon spans over 150 years.</p>

            <p>In this comprehensive history, we'll trace Plinko's evolution from Sir Francis Galton's "quincunx" in the 1870s, through its iconic role on "The Price is Right," to its current status as a popular online casino game. Understanding this history helps appreciate why Plinko remains so engaging - it combines proven scientific principles with the timeless appeal of watching random events unfold.</p>

        <section id="scientific-origins">
            <h2>The Scientific Origins: Francis Galton</h2>
            <p>The mathematical foundation of Plinko dates back to the 1870s, long before the game existed as entertainment.</p>

            <h3>Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911)</h3>
            <p>Francis Galton was a Victorian-era polymath - a cousin of Charles Darwin and pioneer in many fields including statistics, psychology, and meteorology. Among his many inventions was a device to demonstrate probability distributions.</p>

            <h3>The Galton Board (1873)</h3>
            <p>Galton invented what he called the "quincunx" (later known as the Galton Board or bean machine). This device consisted of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A vertical board with rows of pegs arranged in a triangular pattern</li>
                <li>A funnel at the top to release balls or beads</li>
                <li>Collection bins at the bottom to gather the fallen objects</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Purpose and Discovery</h3>
            <p>Galton created the device to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem - a fundamental principle in statistics. When many balls are dropped through the pegs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each ball bounces left or right with equal probability at each peg</li>
                <li>The final positions follow a binomial distribution</li>
                <li>With many balls, this approaches the normal (bell curve) distribution</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scientific Legacy</h3>
            <p>The Galton Board became a standard teaching tool in statistics and probability education. It visually demonstrates concepts that are otherwise abstract:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Random events with equal probability</li>
                <li>How individual randomness creates predictable patterns in aggregate</li>
                <li>The shape of the normal distribution</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This scientific foundation would remain unused for entertainment purposes for over a century.</p>

            <h2>The Price is Right Era (1983-Present)</h2>
            <p>Plinko as we know it today was born on American television.</p>

            <h3>The Birth of Plinko</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 3, 1983</p>
            <p><strong>Show:</strong> The Price is Right (CBS)</p>
            <p><strong>Creator:</strong> Frank Wayne (show producer and game developer)</p>

            <p>Frank Wayne, who developed many pricing games for the show, created Plinko as a new segment. The name reportedly came from the sound the chip makes as it bounces off the pegs - "plink, plink, plink."</p>

            <h3>Original Game Format</h3>
            <p>The TV version of Plinko works as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Contestants are shown four small prizes and their prices</li>
                <li>For each correct price guess, they earn a Plinko chip</li>
                <li>They can earn up to 5 chips (one free + four from pricing)</li>
                <li>Contestants climb to the top of a giant Plinko board</li>
                <li>They drop each chip, which bounces through pegs to land in prize slots</li>
                <li>Center slot: $10,000; Edge slots: Lower amounts or $0</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Iconic Board</h3>
            <p>The Price is Right Plinko board is massive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Approximately 8-9 feet tall</li>
                <li>Multiple rows of pegs</li>
                <li>Slots labeled: $0 - $100 - $500 - $1,000 - $10,000 - $1,000 - $500 - $100 - $0</li>
                <li>Contestants must walk up stairs to drop chips</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Evolution on the Show</h3>
            <p>Over the decades, Plinko evolved on The Price is Right:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1983-1990s:</strong> Maximum prize of $25,000 (5 chips × $5,000)</li>
                <li><strong>1998:</strong> Center slot increased to $10,000, making max $50,000</li>
                <li><strong>Special episodes:</strong> Million Dollar Spectacular featured higher stakes</li>
                <li><strong>Design updates:</strong> Board appearance modernized over the years</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Host Bob Barker's Legacy</h3>
            <p>Bob Barker hosted The Price is Right from 1972 to 2007. His enthusiasm for Plinko segments helped cement the game's popularity. When Drew Carey took over in 2007, Plinko remained a fan favorite, demonstrating its enduring appeal independent of any single host.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Who invented Plinko?</h3>
            <p>The TV game Plinko was created by Frank Wayne for The Price is Right in 1983. The underlying physics concept comes from Francis Galton's quincunx (Galton Board) invented in 1873.</p>

            <h3>Why is it called Plinko?</h3>
            <p>The name reportedly comes from the sound the chip makes as it bounces off the pegs - "plink, plink, plink."</p>

            <h3>Is online Plinko the same as TV Plinko?</h3>
            <p>Online casino Plinko uses the same basic concept (ball/chip falling through pegs) but differs in format: digital balls, adjustable risk levels, multiplier-based payouts, and real-money gambling.</p>

            <h3>Is "Plinko" trademarked?</h3>
            <p>Yes, "Plinko" is a trademark associated with The Price is Right. However, the game mechanic itself (ball drop through pegs) cannot be trademarked, only the specific name and branding.</p>

            <h3>When did Plinko become an online casino game?</h3>
            <p>Real-money online Plinko emerged around 2019-2020, with BGaming's version becoming widely popular by 2021-2022.</p>
